INTRODUCTION<br><br>

The concepts in this book can be adapted to any person in any situation.<br>
The first few points start off with the example of getting a<br>
teenager off drugs.  <br><br><br>


zero.  Hi Nick, How are you?  <br>
a) This first one is for the parents and it is pretty obvious; don't call your teen a zero and do not 'talk over' your child.  <br>
They are actually just looking for someone to listen to them.  <br><br><br>


1.  Hi Nick, did you accomplish your goals to raise your self-esteem today?<br>
a) Were your goals too large to accomplish?<br>
b) Were your goals to small and seemed like a waste of time?<br>
c) Were your goals at a good challenge state for where you are now?<br>
d) Were your goals challenging and after you accomplished them did you feel a sense of happiness and pride?<br>
Are you telling the truth.  If you lie to me you are lying to yourself.  How is your regret level?<br>
e) Doesn't know the definition of 'self-esteem'.  It is not the same as confidence.<br><br>

If you can't tell if your teenager is lying then you might want to read a different book every day<br>
related to the questions in this book.  Or since we live in the modern world...<br>
Google - 'How To Tell When Someone Is Lying'.<br><br><br>


2.  Hi Nick, how is your regret level?<br>
a) Don't have any regret?  Does not know the definition of regret or is blocking regret with constant drug<br>
consumption.<br>
b) How anxious are you feeling?  - hands shaking, mildly paranoid, don't give a fuck, met a nice person today?<br>
If his answer is 'don't give a fuck', WARNING:  Call in the uncle/cops/bitch to apply pressure.<br>
Book:  Feel The Fear And Do It Anyway.<br><br>

"That I have but one life to lose for my country" to Hale.<br>
"To ______ deeply is to life afresh":  Thoreau.<br>
"What if" feeling.<br>
Lament.<br>
Never forgive oneself.<br>
Product of hindsight, sometimes.<br>
Rue.<br>
Wish undone.<br><br><br>


3.  Hi Nick, what are your goals?<br>
a) Don't know.<br>
b) Which one is the most important at this time?<br>
c) Don't give a Fuck.  See question 2 WARNING, and create subliminal/direct intervention.  These questions<br>
are a subliminal intervention.  It is your job as a parent to know which question you should be asking at<br>
which time.  That is trial and error.  Don't push too hard but don't be too soft either.  Sometimes saying<br>
nothing and skipping his question for the day/s  is your correct choice.<br>
And,<br>
Love Will Work on Planet Earth.<br>
Pick the hardest positive thing you can think of<br>
and make it a hobby/goal (math/computers/music/art/sports etc.).<br>
Did someone say love.<br>
Can love be a hobby which I love.<br>
Don't make what you love, 'your job',<br>
you may learn to not love it anymore.<br><br><br>


4.  Hi Nick, are you worth a damn?<br>
To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want.<br>
a) Don't be a victim of your own making.<br>
b) There are no short cuts.<br>
c) How aware are you of your environment?  Increase your awareness daily.  Focus.<br>
d) Would you bet on yourself?<br>
e) Smelling the roses is required, but now is not the time.<br>
f) Be on an upward path to deserve more!<br>
g) The world is way more fair than the media tells you.  Although it is not perfect.<br>
h) People who deserve more, get more.  Don't talk about normal types of trauma, we all have that.<br>
Talk about physical health issues or extreme mental trauma, yes.  What you do now is what sets the stage for what happens next.<br>
How you play your part is all that concerns me.  Play a bigger part.  Perseverance, patients, wisdom, awareness.<br>
i) Don't fall into the trap of making specific rules.<br>
j) Character traits - balance.  Step by step.<br>
k) Bet on yourself.<br>
L) Now invert, who wouldn't you bet on, and try not to be that person.<br><br>

What is your plan to start deserving what you want from life?<br>
On a scale of 1-10 what is your awareness, deserve it, worth a damn factor?  Why do you think you are at that level?<br>
How can you increase it?  If you look back in time at yourself, would you bet on yourself compared to everyone else?<br>
If the answer is no, then what do you have to do now, to be the person that you would bet on?<br>
Are you worth it?  Do you deserve it?  Everyday go to bed a little bit wiser, more aware.<br><br><br>


"I will not try to convince you to love me, to respect me, to commit to me.  <br>
I deserve better than that; I AM BETTER THAN THAT...Goodbye."  <br>
Steve Maraboli <br><br>


5.  Hi Nick, what is the basic law of nature?  Change.<br>
a) Adapt to survive.  You don't have to be the smartest, just be good at adapting.<br>
Those who are the best at adapting are the most successful.<br>
b) Observe, use the information to formulate a better plan.<br>
c) Don't change to quickly/slowly, give things a chance.<br>
d) Ancient invalid thought is trying to control you, be aware of this. Erase it.<br>
e) The world is not always completely black and white, it is a gradient of space from black to white with<br>
many different colors in between.<br>
f) Failure is a learning mechanism an experiment.  Move on to the next event after you have learned;<br>
continuing on towards your goal.<br>
g) Adopt an evolutionary stable strategy.  Nature.<br>
h) Be flexible.  For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.<br>
i) Don't take things personally.<br>
j) Read the obvious signs to search out the best path.  Start with your health.<br>
k) If you want to know the truth, ask why, why, why; then how.<br>
L) Stay strong, adaptation and change can hurt sometimes, but it is better than the slow death of drug addiction.<br>
Embrace the fear and the joy and excitement of the adventure.<br>
m) Build upon your strengths.<br><br>

What is the number one area in your life where you have been to 'black and white' in your approach?<br>
What is your next experiment regarding Health or Wealth or Love or Happiness?<br><br><br>


Adapt yourself to the things among which your lot has been cast and love sincerely the fellow creatures
with whom destiny has ordained that you shall live.  <br>
Marcus Aurelius <br><br>

6.  Hi Nick, have you experienced any humility today?<br>
a) Not outward humility, but a humble inward perspective.  Being able to listen and to be extremely coach-able.<br>
b) Listening with understanding and then going out and doing it.<br>
c) To make this type of humility one of your instincts, a part of who you are,<br>
will be of great benefit.<br>
d) I need your help.  How many mentors have you acquired in your life?<br>
e) You need to know that you don't know everything, be humble on the inside.<br>
Read a book a week.  A factual book or biography.<br>
f) What can you learn from the people around you; learn from everyone you meet.<br>
Even if you learn not to be like that person if they are not so happy.<br>
g) Your greatest skill must be that you are coach-able.<br>
h) Take notes about the things you learn from the people you meet.<br>
j) The more mentors you have the higher your quality of life will be.<br>
Sometimes life as we find it, is too hard for us, we use diversions, intoxications, and gratifications to avoid life.<br>
Humility triggers a fear response and stops us.  Feel the fear and do it anyway.<br>
k) You must go out and do what is necessary.  Prove you are humble and need to learn.<br>
Every minute counts, you never get the days back.  Read more, look for the best part of the book (you don't have to read<br>
the whole book, unless it is one of the good ones).  You can re-read the good books over and over again.<br>
Go to seminars, observe your competitors, increase the amount of time you spend on these ideas.<br>
Find mentors who can teach you, take notes.<br><br>

What is the number one area you have not been humble in action; the areas are health, wealth, love and happiness?<br>
What is the tangible thing you are going to do different?  Now go do it!  You can find the meaningful life!<br><br><br>


Humility is the true key to success.  <br>
Successful people lose their way at times.  <br>
They often embrace and overindulge from the fruits of success.  <br>
Humility halts this arrogance and self-indulging trap.  <br>
Humble people share the credit and wealth, <br>
remaining focused and hungry <br>
to continue the journey of success.  <br>
Rick Pitino <br><br>

7.  Hi Nick, which mentors were you following today?  <br>
a) Use mentors to shave years off your learning curve.  <br>
b) Who are you going to read about?  Who are you going to aspire to be like?  <br>
c) Life has many hard questions.  You will never find all the answers from one person.  <br>
You will need to find a handful of people to learn from.  <br>
d) Good artists copy, great artists steal.  Go steal the knowledge you need to succeed.  <br>
Stand on the shoulders of giants.  A rising tide raises all ships.  <br>
e) Self learning; capitalize on this ability you have!  <br>
f) Having a mentor that you can learn from in person will teach you more than any other form of learning.  <br>
g) The older your mentors are the more experience they will have.  <br>
h) One third of your time should be spent with people below you (you are their mentor).  <br>
One third of your time should be spent with people on your level (they are your friends).  <br>
And one third of your time should be spent with mentors in your field of interest who are 10 - 20 years older than you.  <br>
When you are in a room with your mentors you should be talking less and listening more.  When you are the mentor in the
room then you should be talking more and listening less and
when you are with your friends you should all be talking about the same amount.  <br>
i) Don't feel uncomfortable with people who are above you, push through the fear.  <br>
j) When you succeed you party, but when you fail you ponder and grow.  <br>
k) It's your job as the student to 'get out of' your mentors what you need from them.  They might be rough sometimes.  <br>
The best mentors are not saints; you will have to toughen up!  <br>
L) You must handle the stress when you are with your mentor.  <br>
m) Your mentors are not perfect.  Don't expect perfection from anyone.  Learn their good points!  <br>
n) All the greats had a mentor and then they became the mentor.  Even a great book is a mentor.  <br>
o) You will learn in ways that you don't understand at first, and then it will become clear later.  <br>
p) Nothing is impossible to he who will try!  Try, try, try again!  <br>
q) Take it slow, set an 18 month goal to create a relationship with an in person mentor.  Send them a letter.  <br>
Bump into them on the elevator where their office is.  But don't become a stocker. <br>
r) Phone them, say you would like to interview them for an essay (or blog interview/book club etc.) you are writing <br>
and after the interview send them a little gift.  <br>
s) Sometimes you will have to give up, but try 10 or 20 times to get a relationship with the mentor of your choice.  <br>
t) Get a list of possible mentors.  Think big, one of them will respond.  <br>
It may take 18 months to get a high/medium/low level mentor.  <br>
u) Pitfalls - mentors are human and sometimes you need to withdraw from the relationship.  <br>
The mentor may not have a lot of time; they only see you once every 5 years, that is not a mentor.  <br>
v) Books and videos are a mentor but a mentor in person is a way better way to learn.  <br>
w) Don't forget to be flattering, and don't forget that little gift.  Try to give something back.  <br>
Three 'gives' for one piece of knowledge.  Don't be clingy, be interesting, <br>
read more and acquire knowledge.  Become totally aware.  <br><br>

Who are your 10 potential mentors (actual people)?  A listers, B listers, C listers...  <br>
How are you going to cultivate a relationship with them within the next 18 months?  <br>
Have fun, this is something exciting to do!  <br><br><br>


I never had a strategy about my life.  <br>
I didn't have enough information to have a strategy.  <br>
I'm the first person in my family to go to college.  <br>
I had no family mentors...  <br>
Alan Dershowitz <br><br>

8.  Hi Nick, are you having fun acquiring knowledge?<br>
a) Are you taking steps to implement that knowledge towards your desires for health, wealth, happiness and love?  <br>
b) How are you assimilating knowledge?  <br>
c) Are you finding the best sources to get the best information?  <br>
d) Are you tuning in on the awareness factor?  <br>
e) Who are your rich friends, who are your poor friends?  Not just money here but everything about them.  <br>
f) What are the differences between these types of friends?  Do you notice the differences?  <br>
g) Don't try to teach pigs how to fly, because they don't like it.  <br>
You can judge a tree by its fruit.  The stronger the wind, the stronger the tree.  <br>
h) The way you speak makes a difference.  It is a reflection of the way you think, of what's in your brain.  <br>
i) You don't have to have all the answers.  But watch out for your opinion, maybe it needs more experience.  <br>
What are the known facts (which of course can change), quote other people, the experts from the past.  <br>
j) Tip - Turn a service into a market place.  You can make way more money.  <br>
k) People who are successful want to know what YOU can teach them!  <br>
L) Getting advice from rich (not just money) friends shouldn't become an affront to your pride.  <br>
m) Become a self-learning machine.  Who are your happy friends and who are your poor friends, <br>
what are the differences?  <br>
n) Your successful (happiest) friends are disciplined, always doing the right thing.  Make no mistake about it!  <br>
Everything in moderation.  Be hyper aware of this!  Are you worth a damn?  <br>
o) Half of your success is just understanding what you are reading here; the rest is your actions.  <br>
p) How do your friends walk, how do they talk, when do they talk, what is their body language saying, <br>
pay attention to all the details (patterns).  <br>
q) Make math a hobby, all my rich friends know math (patterns), learn the language of money (definitions).  <br>
You may not need calculus; everything in moderation.  <br>
r) What do your friends eat, are your rich/poor friends eating that which contributes to who they are?  <br>
Is there a pattern?  Yes of course!  Every decision a person makes defines the path they are on <br>
and where they will eventually end up.  Which path are you on at this moment?  <br>
s) Tune your mind to the concepts (behaviours) of your rich friends and poor friends.  <br>
Accurate thoughts and inaccurate thoughts, which friends have which thoughts?  <br>
What is the risk reward for all choices and actions, who do you want to spend time with?  <br>
t) A great detective has found the path to happiness, and is following it.  Observe.  <br>
u) If you don't have any friends, start with your family or a book, <br>
become an interesting person and then get out there and have fun.  <br>
v) Don't expect to get the advice you are looking for, the truth can be mysterious.  <br>
But as a seeker you will find it!  You are a seeker as you have read this book up to this point, <br>
congratulations you are on the correct path!  <br><br>

What is one profound lesson you have learned, that shows the difference between one rich friend and one poor friend?  <br>
Stay reliable and take, this, step!  <br><br><br>


Wisdom is the right use of knowledge.  <br>
To know is not to be wise.  <br>
Many men know a great deal, and are all the greater fools for it.  <br>
There is no fool so great a fool as a knowing fool.  <br>
But to know how to use knowledge is to have wisdom.  <br>
Charles Spurgeon <br><br>

9.  Hi Nick, are you getting better at seeing that which influences you unconsciously?  <br>
a) Is the media sculpting your thoughts?  Are they just trying to make money on other peoples pain/pleasure?  <br>
Take a break from the news.  Look at the last 6000 years instead, there is some good there and way more wisdom.  <br>
b) Is the media bias skewing what you think because they are telling you the same thing over and over?  <br>
Not just the media, but anything you read/see/hear from any constant source. <br>
c) Does the term 'conspiracy theory' influence you?  Is it really a conspiracy or just another spin <br>
on the same old story to sell you more magazines etc?  <br>
d) Do you think that documentaries would give you a better view of what is really going on?  Of course!  <br>
e) Will a conscious effort on your part create what you want in life?  Of course!  <br>
Learn to enjoy the good grind, find the hard work which makes you tap dance your way to work.  <br>
Instead of waiting for the lottery ticket to 'come in' take a slab of marble and chip away at it <br>
one bit at a time (the daily grind) until it is sculpted the way you want it to be.  Your life.  <br>
f) How will you create health/wealth/love/happiness?  Which piece of marble will you start with?  Find your strengths.  <br>
That is your natural destiny.  <br><br>

What is your style/archetype:  <br><br>

Action - <br>
f1) Protagonist - An advocate or champion of a particular cause or idea.  <br>
f2) Antagonist - A person who actively opposes or is hostile to someone or something; an adversary.  <br><br>

Thinking - <br>
f3) Reason - The Reason archetypal character is calm, collected, and cool, perhaps even cold/logical.  <br>
f4) Emotion - The Emotion character is uncontrolled and driven by feelings.  As in real life, Reason is <br>
not inherently better than Emotion, nor does Emotion have the edge on Reason.  <br><br>

Social - <br>
f5) Sidekick - The Sidekick is the faithful supporter, usually attached to the Protagonist.  <br>
f6) Skeptic - The Skeptic balances the Sidekick.  The Skeptic is the disbelieving 'opposer'.  <br><br>

Practical - <br>
f7) Guardian - The Guardian functions as a teacher/helper who represents the conscience of the mind.  <br>
This is a protective character that removes obstacles and brightens the path ahead.  <br>
f8) Contagonist -  Archetype character representing the motivations of temptation and hinder.  <br>
A character who is generally on the hero/heroine's side in the story as they want the hero/heroine to achieve their ultimate goal.  <br><br>

You are not just one of the above but a blend of two or more.  See if you can find your blend.  <br>
Try to figure out the style/blend of people you know.  <br>
Attempt to relate to people with the type of speech that their blend might broadcast.  <br>
You will have to contemplate this for many months to get good at it.  <br>
Memorize the definitions of the 8 archetypes first.  <br><br>

Don't let the news/magazines/internet etc. influence your natural destiny.  <br>
Read factual/biographical books which are within your style.  <br>
Enlightenment - knowing when YOU, are not enlightened!  <br>
An enlightened person is someone who has a deep understanding of what their personal blend type looks like in different situations.  <br>
Your blend type is in a constant state of flux.  Know what state you are in and put yourself in a beneficial state
for the current situation you find yourself in.  <br>
g) Do you embrace the truth?  Don't be tethered by conventional thinking.  <br>
Be only bound by the laws of physics, everything else is open for discussion.  Control the media you consume.  <br>
Beware the over simplification of things, this is called narrative bias.  Find the full story.  <br>
Beware short stories which have some truth, the details are not all there.  The internet has tons of narrative bias.  <br>
h) It will take at least two months to rewire your brain, but give yourself more time and work on it continuously.  <br>
Plant those seeds and nurture them to full bloom and then the planting season starts again, over and over.  <br>
i) If you start with a penny and double it every day for a month, how much money will you have at the end of the month?  <br>
Or would you rather have $1,000,000 given to you with no doubling?  Which do you choose?  <br>
The penny doubling of course!  Do the math!!!<br>  What is your end goal?  <br>
1 penny - 2 pennies - 4 pennies - 8 pennies, and then on day 5 you have 16 pennies, continue this math...  <br>
There is no quick fix, chip away at the rock.  Day after day step by step, give yourself time and in 18 months <br>
you will have advanced.  <br><br>

What is the number one area in your life (health/wealth/love/happiness, pick one) where you have taken the quick <br>
fix approach, and what was the result?  What will your new approach be?  <br>
And write down the specific steps you will take.  <br>
There are no short-cuts.  <br>
Use your style, it is great!  <br><br><br>


Seemingly minor yet persistent things penetrate the mind over time  <br>
making it difficult to ever realize the impact; hence, <br>
though quite unfortunate, the most dangerous forms of corruption <br>
are those that are subtle and below the radar.  <br>

10.  Hi Nick, are you out of the cage and in the jungle?  <br>
a) Learned optimism is a survival trait; learned pessimism will put you back in the cage.  <br>
b) A dog in a closed box with an electric pad underneath it gets shocked every 2 minutes and since <br>
it can't get out of the box it eventually learns to just lay down every time it gets shocked.  <br>
Then the lid is taken off the box and the dog gets shocked again.  What do you think the dog does?  <br>
It just lays down again, it has acquired learned helplessness (pessimism).  This experiment was actually done.  <br>
Luckily you are not a dog and have the capacity to change your mental framework; your subconscious conditioning <br>
that others and the 500 year old archaic mind have imposed upon you.  You are now out of the cage and in the jungle!  <br>
c) Our modern education system also tends to breed learned helplessness.  They tell you what the goal is, <br>
they tell you what book to read and they tell you what they think you should learn.  <br>
Instead of just saying "here is a library, go there, find what interests you, and learn it!"  <br>
Eventually you become dependent on someone telling you what you should do and think and the next thing you know <br>
you are a salary slave working in some job you hate.  <br>
d) Self education is of primary importance.  Read a book a day and you will advance faster than light!  <br>
There is nothing wrong with going to school but learn to keep an open mind and explore outside of the cage as well.  <br>
e) And of course don't just wait for the next book to come out, use what you know so far and take action to <br>
acquire the things you want regarding health, wealth, love and happiness.  <br>
f) Depending on what country you live in, you may not want to wander too far into the jungle.  <br>
You must keep everything in perspective depending on your current situation.  <br>
g) Take a risk, no pain, no gain.  The risk these days is so small you might as well get out there and get the rewards.  <br>
h) Some things are out of our control but most are not.  Learn to know the difference by taking action and trying.  <br>
i) The antithesis of helplessness is creativity.  Innovate your way out of this learned helplessness.  <br>
j) What did you want to do career wise when you were 14?  Why didn't you pursue that?  Did you innovate your way <br>
into that field or did the learned helplessness stop you.  <br>
Of course not all dreams are feasible and it is wise to give up on them and move on to something more realistic.  <br>
k) If you do enough practice you will be able to grow into the role that makes you happy!  <br>
Work hard, never give up!  <br><br>

Write down one specific instance (health, wealth, love, happiness) from your past where you have felt helpless.<br>
Write down how you would have changed that.  Be as specific as possible.  <br><br><br>


I know of nothing more moving, indeed semi-tragic, <br>
than the yearning helplessness in the face of a dog, <br>
who understands what is said to him, <br>
and cannot answer!  <br>
Bayard Taylor <br><br>

11.  Hi Nick, are you learning how to achieve the integrated good life?  <br>
a) Linear reductionist - Reductionism refers to several related but distinct philosophical positions regarding the <br>
connections between phenomena, or theories, "reducing" one to another, usually considered "simpler" or more "basic".  <br>
We must move past a linear reductionist view of our life's work.  <br>
We have been trained to compartmentalize our lives; we need to integrate the four pillars of life.  <br>
Your health, wealth, love and happiness must be working in synergy.  <br>
Friends, co-workers, church members etc, everyone working together with you.  <br>
"I Hate Monday's", "Thank God It's Friday" etc, these are ideas of compartmentalized thoughts and <br>
close your mind to better thoughts.  <br>
b) Eudaimonia - A Greek word commonly translated as happiness or welfare; however, "human flourishing" has <br>
been proposed as a more accurate translation.  <br>
The four pillars of eudaimonia - In a sense we are reducing self fulfilment to 4 things (health, wealth, love, happiness) <br>
but they should not be separated, they should be integrated.  <br>
You don't just do health on Monday, then wealth on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then love is just on Friday; everyday, all four.  <br>
This is of course obvious but still people compartmentalize even further until their mind fragments into chaos.  <br>
Wear this green shirt on Saturday that blue shirt on Monday, drive car number 7 on Sunday etc.  If you have 7 cars lol.  <br>
Some schedule is necessary but the schedule should be integrated with all the facets of self fulfilment.  <br>
And on some days just do nothing, maybe you need a break from the daily grind.<br>
And take a break from technology now and then, <br>
you will get a different perspective and new ideas will flow into you.  <br>
Go people watching it will stimulate your creative side.  <br>
c) If you're an adult remember this rule:  Everything should be within a two mile distance from you.  <br>
Your job, the store etc., integrated, closer together.  <br>
d) The seven theory:  Life with too many ups means life with many downs, everyday should be a 7.  Everyday should <br>
be a good day.  Integrated, smooth, not chaotic and out of control.  One day up, one day down, that's no good.  <br>
e) Focus every moment of your life on the integration of health, wealth, love, and happiness; <br>
and search for purposes larger than yourself to achieve maximum fulfilment.  <br>
f) Lift weights while you are on the phone, synergy, integrate everything.  Read a book then take a nap to <br>
re-energize your brain so you can do more each day.  <br>
g) If you're single, get a job where there are people you want to meet.  Integrate love and work and everything else.  <br>
h) Ponder this idea of integration but don't beat yourself up if you can't integrate everything.  <br>
i) Take some time, have fun with this idea, you can do it!  <br><br>

Write down how you can integrate two of the 4 pillars of life.  Choose any two you like and integrate them.  <br>
Start with health and work first, because those two are the easiest.  Or start with which ever two you want if you have <br>
those two linked already.  <br><br><br>


"You cannot imagine the craving for rest that I feel - a hunger and thirst.  <br>
For six long days, since my work was done, my mind has been a whirlpool, <br>
swift, unprogressive and incessant, <br>
a torrent of thoughts leading nowhere, <br>
spinning round swift and steady"  <br>
H.G. Wells <br><br>

12.  Hi Nick, are you thinking like a billionaire?  <br>
a) Which books did you scan today?  What type of information have you been focusing on from the internet?  <br>
b) Is your "super power goal" to be the fastest reader in the world?  <br>
c) Do you know what the difference is between a rich man's house and a poor man's house?  <br>
A rich man's house has a library and a poor man's house does not!  <br>
d) Do you have mental blocks when it comes to books?  <br>
Are you inventing reasons why you can't do it?  <br>
Are you saying it's not important?  <br>
Are you saying it's not what's in your head, it's what you do?  What you do is in your head, first!  <br>
Are you saying it's about street smarts and not book smarts.  Who do you think designs the streets and designs the pavement?  <br>
There are more streets (paths/opportunities) at university/education than there are at skid row!  <br>
Is not information power???  <br>
e) Survival machines which can simulate the future will win over survival machines which only rely on trial and error.  <br>
A simulation takes seconds to test, while trial and error can take days or even months to test and can sometimes be fatal.  <br>
f) Three failures and you quit?  No, you never quit, simulate 11 strategies, then pick the one you think is best and try again!  <br>
Repeat...  <br>
g)  It's ok to learn by making your own mistakes (trial and error), but it's a heck of a lot easier to learn from other peoples mistakes.  <br>
Read about their experiences, and avoid the pitfalls that they fell into, and learn the smart ways that they eventually found.  <br>
You only have so much time on this planet and you better move as fast as possible or you will be forever in your sad cage.  <br>
h) Who are your counsellors, who are you seeking out to help you?  Those who are successful make war with a multitude of wise counsellors;  <br>
accountants, doctors, advisers, experts etc.  <br>
i) Read enough books on a subject and the wisdom gained will become instinctual.  <br>
j) You don't have to read the entire book.  Look for the golden nuggets in the book.  <br>
Scan the inside cover, the contents, the back cover, the last page of the book, and the index.  <br>
Flip to the 'chapter title' which peaks your interest.  <br>
You must find the best books.  Google - 'Best health/wealth/love/happiness books'.  <br>
Write notes in the book and come back to the book later and read some more of it.  <br>
You can read more than one book at a time, you don't have to read the entire book.  <br>
There are too many books, and maybe another book has a higher calibre of gold.  <br>
Just get one nugget of gold then repeat this process with another book.  <br>
You can always come back to that book later!  <br>
Make your target to read one great book per week.  Another super important technique is to read three great books a day.  <br>
In the morning read a classical book that has survived the test of time.  <br>
In the afternoon read a factual/how to book (then take a 15 - whatever, minute power nap) <br>
and read a biography/autobiography before bed, this will build your courage.  <br>
Just two to 40 minute sessions is all it takes.  <br>
Some fiction is ok, but it depends on the type of fiction.  Don't read horror before bed time.  <br>
Go easy on the fiction, how much truth is there?  <br>
k)  Side note about sleep:  In no time during history did humans ever fall asleep without some kind of noise in the back ground except in <br>
the modern world.  If you are having trouble falling asleep at night experiment with white noise or nature sounds from your sound system.  <br>
L) Break the rules (but not the law) when it comes to reading.  You can also read the same great book over and over; it will become part <br>
of your instincts.  <br>
Leaders are readers, the ability to simulate the future without wasting time on trial and error and fatal mistakes!<br>
Now go, read, it's fun!  <br><br>

What is it for you that holds you back from reading, write that down?  <br>
Don't let bad reading experiences (crappy boring books you were not interested in) <br>
from middle school hold you back, <br>
push through that early pain and you will be amazed and gain.  Rewire your brain, <br>
reading is one of the fastest ways to do it!  <br><br>

What pace of reading are you going to commit to?  Write down the titles of the next three books you are going to read.  <br>
Google - 'the best books on...' (the subjects that interest you the most).  <br><br><br>


Vision is perhaps our greatest strength...it has kept us alive to the power <br>
and continuity of thought through the centuries, <br>
it makes us peer into the future and lends shape to the unknown.  <br>

13.  Hi Nick, how are you, are you getting stronger, are you toughening up? <br>
Stoic - To forego present pleasure in order to receive future rewards.  <br>
Epicurean - Live for the now, eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die.  <br>
YOLO - You only live once.  <br>
a) A nation is born stoic and dies epicurean.  That statement has been proven throughout history, over and over.  Memorize it.  <br>
Now you don't want to be in a state of stoicism continuously, but for every action there is an opposite and <br>
equal re-action.  <br>
b) If you party all the time you die early (health goes to zero) <br>
and you experience depression every time you are coming down.  <br>
Eventually the partying gets boring and so, do, the brain, dead, people, you are partying with!  <br>
After that the regret bites you hard and even suicide comes to your plate as you look back and see nothing, not even memories.  <br>
No memories of happiness and accomplishments that helped others or even yourself.  <br>
c) Toughen up, taking some pain today for some awesome gain tomorrow.  <br>
Face the fear, it's excitement and overcoming it is exhilarating!  It is good stress.  <br>
d) Stress can be good or bad, it all depends on how you think about your stress.  <br>
That has been scientifically proven (see - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_stress) . <br>
Now I'm not talking about a constant threat of violence against you, that type of stress would <br>
be bad no matter how you think about it, but we don't live in Afghanistan!  <br>
Toughen up, what's the worst thing that can happen to you?  Death?  <br>
e) This one's over the top - Adversity makes men, prosperity (weak drug addicts, soft life styles, absolute power
corrupts absolutely etc.) can make monsters.  Scary.  <br>
f) There are three types of people in the world:  <br>
People who make things happen, <br>
People who watch things happen, <br>
and People who wonder what happened!  <br>
g) How soft are you?  If you are wondering what happened to your life, toughen up.  <br>
h) Modern convenience is great but it comes at an expense; the expense of weakening our will to create, to survive, to build, to dream!  <br>
i) Toughen up, lose your technology for a month, go camping, sleep on the hard ground without a pillow.  <br>
j) Do a marathon, ride a bike, go for a walk to the store instead of taking the bus.  <br>
k) Don't let the media sell you depression pills, diabetic foods, instant gratification in the form of plastic wrapped pleasures.  <br>
Even heavy metal is just pre-packaged rebellion.  They just want your money.  <br>
L) Ok, going crazy now and then is fun, but make it a ritual you do once a month or so, but not every day.  <br>
You will fall into the hole and lose your sole (perspective).  Sounds like heavy metal lyrics lol.  <br>
Got to admit, art, music and other creative endeavours (sculpting your body, sports) are very cool.  Toughen up and do those things.  <br>
Sell your own piece of the pie, go for the good life, toughen up and get the good life, don't just lay there <br>
all helpless and stoned.  Boring...  <br>
m) When you are in a room full of people and you don't know who the sucker is, YOU are the sucker.  <br>
n) Anything worth doing is never easy.  It's about the journey, the struggle, the good fight, not the destination.  <br>
Look at some of those people who win the lottery, 3 years later they are broke again...go figure, do the math.  <br>
o) Face your fears, today is a good day to die (don't over dose though, that's boring)!  <br>
p) The more you toughen up the less of a slave you will be to your environment.  <br>
The reward will be infinite, stick with it, just do it.  Just do it to mess with your brain when you don't feel like it.  <br>
That will rewire your brain.  <br>
You control your brain, your brain does not control you.  <br>
Build slowly, take 18 months, don't go overboard with these ideas but find your pace which is in balance with where you are now.  <br>
q) SEEK out adversity, whatever you are afraid of you must do, IT IS A RUSH!!!  <br>
And then and only then, will the world give up its rewards and fruits to you!  <br><br>


In what area of your life (health, wealth, love, happiness) have you become the weakest?  <br>
What is a simple practical step that you can do slowly to rewire your brain, be specific.  <br>
Nations are born stoic and die epicurean.  Think of happiness as the balanced life.  <br><br><br>


That strong mother doesn't tell her cub, Son, stay weak so the wolves can get you.  <br>
She says, Toughen up, this is reality we are living in.  <br>
Lauryn Hill <br><br>

14.  Hi Nick, are you getting excellent at knowing when it is better to follow your logic than your instincts?  <br>
a) The impulses (instincts) that have served you in the past have been passed down to you from tens of thousands <br>
of generations ago.  That which had worked for your ancestors, and has been passed on down to you over time, <br>
may not work so well today because the world has changed.  Our instincts tell us that when you find sugar or <br>
carbs you should eat as much as you can because there may be no food around tomorrow.  And so those instincts <br>
"kick us now" in the modern world as food is everywhere.  You need to engage your logic and wisdom.  <br>
You should know by now that sugar and carbs make you fat, diabetic, depressed etc.  <br>
b) Problems with sleeping are also connected to your instincts.  We did not evolve in a world where there were a lot of <br>
lights on all the time.  The sun was it...  <br>
So in the modern world we sometimes stay up to late and then we get all sorts of problems regarding <br>
sleep disorders.  We also did not evolve in a world where it was perfectly quite when we were falling asleep.  <br>
That also causes a problem going to sleep.  You may want to experiment with white noise as mentioned earlier in this book.  <br>
c) Your instincts also serve a purpose, you're in the cross walk walking across the street and you hear a high powered engine <br>
zooming and you naturally get out of the way as fast as possible.  <br>
Well all of the above is pretty obvious if you have been paying attention to the discoveries of science, so stop killing yourself <br>
and make the correct decisions.  Why would you want to have all the above problems?  Are you a victim of your own making playing <br>
out the role of learned helplessness?  Are you a dog in shock box, with the lid taken off?  <br>
Time to jump to greater heights and get what you really want in life (health, wealth, love, happiness).  <br>
Fear is just a four letter word???  Reverse psychology.  <br>
d) Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die, no we don't die (this is the modern world), <br>
save your money for the future instead of spending it as soon as you get it.  <br>
There may be dark days ahead and you will still be here, so some preparation is paramount.  <br>
e) Develop strategies to avoid things that are bad for you, don't stock your kitchen with sugar and carbs for example.  <br>
f) When it comes to love (romance, family, friends) it has been shown that we are far happier when we associate with others.  <br>
Make plans to meet people instead of making plans to do drugs.  Get rid of the friends who do drugs, they will only bring you down <br>
in the long run.  <br>
Don't do down!  It's a drag.  <br>
g) Revive old friendships with the good people from your past. <br>
Find people who are helping others and join them, make those types of people your friends (NO DRUG DEALERS/GANGS).  <br>
h) Do you want the good life?  Use your logic to master your instincts!  <br>
You control the dog, the dog does not control you!<br><br>

In what area of your life (health, wealth, love, happiness) are your instincts not working in your favour?  <br>
What can you do to change that?  Write it down and be specific!  <br><br><br>


Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, <br>
the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection.  <br>
Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction, <br>
generality and individuality.  <br>
Richard Courant<br><br>



15.  Hi Nick, how's it going?  Do you know what you're doing with your life?  <br>
Can you sum it up in one simple sentence?  <br>
a) What is your one main strength and are you combining it with your destiny plan? <br>
Sum it up in one simple sentence!  <br>
b) Don't forget we are competing with 7 billion people; we don't really have as <br>
many choices as we think, so be realistic with your plan.<br>
c) Make a plan that energizes, YOU.  You must be tap dancing your way to work.  <br><br>

d) Where is the focus of the 4 things that combine to make your specific strength/destiny?  <br>
d1) Who did you grow up around?  What were they like and in what positive ways did they influence you?  <br>
Even if they were the meanest people in the world there is always some good in everyone.  <br>
You may have to search hard to find it but it is there, in you!  Search yourself (if necessary) to find 'their self'.  <br>
d2) What type of feedback have you had from strangers in your life?  What positive things did they say to you?  <br>
d3) What have you been doing for the past 10 years or what did you want to be when you were 14 years old?  <br>
That is a big part of you.  <br>
d4) What can you talk about effortlessly?  <br>
Where do the above 4 things intersect, that is your unique strength!  <br><br>

e) Find your health strength/destiny, your wealth strength/destiny, your love strength/destiny and your happiness strength/destiny.  <br>
f) Finding your strength/destiny will cause self fulfilment.<br><br>

Start with this one:  What is your one sentence simple business plan?<br>
Then once you have that down, do a simple sentence about the others (health, love, happiness).<br><br><br>

no longer to carry rain or usher storm, <br>
but to add color to my sunset sky.  <br>

16.  Hi Nick, are you setting up your life so your work is your vacation?  <br>
a) A life where the end game "is the vacation" isn't a life.  <br>
b) Your life, is your work, although you may need some down time now and then. <br>
Your down time can be a ritual; perhaps on a Saturday or Sunday you work a little bit less and go to a movie.  <br>
c) Never let a dichotomy rule your life, a dichotomy in which you hate what you do, so you can have pleasure in your spare time.  <br>
That is a nightmare; look for work that will give you as much pleasure as your spare time!  <br>
d) If you have a job that you need a vacation from, then never come back.  <br>
e) A life built 'around' vacation is really no life at all.  <br>
f) Now some people say that you should do what you love, but this can also lead to problems.  <br>
Never do what you love, because the second you do it for work you may find that you don't love it anymore.  <br>
The repetition might kill the love.  <br>
You should do what you like!  <br>
Don't be chasing the mirage, what do I love, what do I love...  <br>
g) You need to balance what you do, maybe a bit of love, but you must have a whole bunch of 'I like it a lot'.  <br>
Just like in marriage the lust part of the love wares off over a period of time and you are left with a lesser version of the love.  <br>
Although books have been written on how to keep that going as well, but that is beyond the scope of this book.  <br>
You must have a like ability factor for your job which is integrated with all aspects of who you are.  <br>
i) Having said all this it may be that you should do what you love.  Is your job integrated with all of your 'strength/destinies' <br>
as discussed in question 15 above.  The devils in the details, it all depends on who you are.  <br>
Know thyself and happiness will appear instantly (once you master your demons)!  <br>
j) It's all about the ebb and flow of the daily cycle, everyday should have some vacation in it.  <br>
But don't make the mistake of using drugs or junk food etc as part of the vacation, all drugs guarantee depression!  <br>
Even sugar and anything made from wheat causes depression!  TO DO - Google "depression from wheat".  <br>
k) Cat nap, meditate, find what works for you; these things will mellow your mind into a state of power.  <br>
L) Tap dance your way to work with a twinkle in your eye every day!  <br>
Now some days are not going to be great but if you aren't tap dancing consistently then it is time to make a change.  <br>
m)  Missed opportunities are ok, but you don't want to miss the opportunities that jive with YOU!  <br>
n) Build upon your strengths.  <br>
o) Evaluate your life in the morning that is when your mind is the strongest.  Stop the caffeine if this is not true for you.  <br>
Caffeine is a drug, all drugs guarantee depression!  <br><br>

Have you been hating your job and dreaming of your vacation time?  <br>
Are you in danger of pursuing something you "lust after" as opposed to something you like?  <br>
If the answer is "yes" to any of the above two questions, write down what you are going to do differently!  <br>
During the last two months/years have you been popping out of bed and tap dancing your way to work?  <br>
If not, what will you do to change yourself so that you can eventually become the master?  <br><br>

A vacation is what you take when you can no longer take what you've been taking.  <br>
Earl Wilson <br><br>

17. Hi Nick, what's new?  Are you taking responsibility for everything that happens in your life?  <br>
a) It is true that sometimes shit just happens and there is nothing you can do about it.  <br>
You have the power to change the things that are within your control, <br>
you have the power to accept the things that you cannot control, <br>
and you have the wisdom to know the difference between those two types of things.  <br>
b) Anything bad that happens to you, that you could have prepared for when things where good, is your fault.  <br>
That is the level of responsibility that you must achieve.  <br>
c) Prepare, prepare, prepare, you need to bring more tools to the battle if you want to win!  <br>
If you don't have it in your head, you will have to have it in your heal.  In other words, if you aren't smart enough to prepare <br>
you will have to take the physical (and mental) pain of life over and over again.  <br>
d) Optimism is the best but it's ok to have a little pessimism if it helps you prepare for the worst.  <br>
e) The only thing that is guaranteed is change, you must prepare for the change.  <br>
f) Check yourself before you wreck yourself and don't get attached to some weird dogma.  <br>
g) Now don't blame yourself for everything that happens, it's impossible to prepare for everything.  <br>
You must find the balance between optimism and pessimism.  <br>
i) Your end game thoughts must be optimistic, and your "now preparation thoughts" should have a little pessimism.  <br>
j) Don't be a zombie passing through life chasing the mirage.  <br>
k) We are constantly in "the preparation" for life.  Plant the fields today, have food tomorrow etc.  <br>
Who wants the pain, do you want to take it in the heal, touch an electric fence?  <br>
What can I do today to prepare for the biological, personal, social, and economic crises that could occur over the next weak/years?  <br>
L) You don't have to prepare continuously, but take 30 seconds, at least, now and then.  <br>
Do not put off until tomorrow that which you can do today!  <br>
m) The challenges of life should make you happy.  Without challenges life would be boring. <br>
And when something bad happens to you, don't freak out and beat yourself up, just push it off and say, <br>
"next time I will do better", and then go and prepare!  <br>
n) Go to the old age home 4 times a year and talk to the old people.  There is a lot of wisdom there.  <br>
Read as much as possible, it is a great way to prepare.  <br>
Be a learning machine!  <br><br>

What is an example from one area of your life (health, wealth, love, happiness) where you have taken it "in the heal"?  <br>
How could you have prepared to prevent that pain?  Write it down!!!  <br>
No abdication (failure to fulfill a responsibility or duty), and no fixation on "the bad" that happened, move on, prepare again!  <br><br><br>


You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.  <br>
Abraham Lincoln <br><br>

18.  Hi Nick, have you noticed that when you seek for anything, the only thing that remains is the truth?  <br>
a) I think therefore I am.  <br>
Thought experiment - Remove everything that you could possibly doubt, what would be left?  <br>
The only thing that would be left is truth, math, love and change.  <br>
Let's just boil it all down to math.  <br>
Don't get scared, we are not going to learn calculus here lol.  <br>
Why are we discussing this.  Example - if you want to master the wealth part of life you are going to need to know the basics <br>
of math and the language of money (definitions for that language can be found in books, of course).  <br>
b) You must be able to quantify things to make decisions that match up with what you are trying to get.  <br>
c) Take your diet, how many calories are you allowed to eat if you are trying to lose weight.  Math...<br>
d) Math doesn't have to be hard; it can tell you a lot.  <br>
e) Let's be practical, what are the odds of getting what you want, should you make the decision or should <br>
you stay where you are?  Get out your calculator out and estimate the math!  <br>
Should I keep this friend, what are the pluses and the minuses?  <br>
f) Should I start a new business because it will make me happier or should I stay with my current job  <br>
because it is a guaranteed income?  What are the odds of the new business being successful vs the odds of it failing?  <br>
What is the dollar/happiness reward ratio for the new business vs the dollar/happiness ratio for my current stable job?  <br>
g) Should I take a chance on love or is this person too unstable?  <br>
Get out your calculator and try to estimate the odds (math).  <br>
Do you want the good life?  Are you the type who doesn't push himself?  <br>
Are you just going to give up and <br>
say , "but I'm no good at math"?  <br>
Do you make excuses not to do what is necessary for success in any aspect of your life?  <br>
h)  Many things in life will be wrong but one plus one always equals 2.  <br>
i) If life wasn't difficult it would be boring.  Do the hardest positive thing you can think of and make it a hobby!  <br>
You will be amazed at what you can accomplish, it will become easier as you get better at it; practice, practice practice!
Go play some poker or other games of chance which increase you math/logic circuits.  <br>
These ideas will help to rewire your brain so that health, wealth, love and happiness increase tenfold.  <br>
The phrase 'tenfold' is math.  Even if you don't like math, you are using it every day anyway, so you see, <br>
you are good at math!!!  This idea of using math is just a new mind set, don't get obsessed with it.  <br><br>

Write down a big decision that you are contemplating and attempt to quantify it <br>
(figure out the odds of success/failure, happy outcome vs sad outcome, value vs cost).  <br>
Get out your calculator and attempt to take the direct path to success!  <br><br><br>


"Everything passes, only truth remains."  <br>
Fyodor Dostoyevsky, The Brothers Karamazov <br><br>

A lion of truth never assumes anything without validity.  <br>
Assumptions are quick exits for lazy minds that like to graze out in the fields without bother.  <br>
Suzy Kassem <br><br>

19.  Hi Nick, are you becoming awesome at embracing controversy?  <br>
a) You must become a well-rounded person to be successful in life and mastering controversy is one <br>
of those challenges that you must excel at to succeed.  <br>
b) Attempt to look at all sides of the story, don't just blindly follow what everyone else is following.  <br>
c) The people in the background who run society are all well-educated and have many experiences, they are <br>
well rounded.  <br>
Language, art, history, music, sports, etc, you must bring it all together and make it a part of you if you want to go to the top.  <br>
That doesn't mean you have to spend your entire life locked away studying, but take some time <br>
to look at everything you can at least once in life.  <br>
And then study your ass off on that which interests you the most, and if your interests change over time then study that as well.  <br>
You can always come back to what you were studying before.  And read the best stuff, it will influence you in a positive direction!  <br>
d) And once you have gained enough experience from studying go out into the world and take action.  <br>
Focus, and "make what you want" happen!  <br>
e) A bad chef with many ingredients in the kitchen will cook a better meal than <br>
the best chef in the world who only has one ingredient in the kitchen.  <br>
f) Even if you are the smartest person in the world, it is still easier/faster to learn from others than it is to think it up yourself.  <br>
g) You must enhance your sense of perspective; this requires studying a little bit of history.  <br>
Where did you come from?  How are your current thoughts influenced by what has happened in not only "your recent past" but the past <br>
of others from 6000 years ago!!!  The psychological download pattern that is "in you" has been handed down <br>
since 2 million years ago; or longer, if you want to talk about instincts.  <br>
h) Gain insight with these ideas, don't just be a cog in the machine who has far too few choices.  <br>
i) Being a well-rounded person will also make you a more interesting person.  Other successful people will be attracted to you <br>
and they will want to work with you.  <br>
Who you know is very important in getting ahead.  <br>
It's not "what you know, it's who you know" has a lot of truth to it <br>
but in order to attract those successful giants, who's shoulders you will need to stand on, <br>
you must be interesting and knowledgeable and well-rounded.  <br>
j) You don't want to be a "Jack of all trades" but look at everything, "focus" on an exponential curve ie spend the most time <br>
on that which interests you the most and less time on things that don't interest you so much.  <br>
History should get at least a medium amount of your time.  You must study the great ones from the past; those who have done something similar to
what you want to do!  <br>
L) Putting all the above ideas together may cause controversy, you must embrace the controversy, it will create new/original ideas in you!  <br><br>

What are you the weakest on:  language, art, history, music, sports, politics etc.  <br>
Commit yourself to learning both sides of the story; controversy.  <br>
Write down a solution to get better at the one thing that you are the weakest on.  <br>
What is your resolution?  Now go do it!  <br><br><br>


"People say graffiti is ugly, irresponsible and childish...  <br>
but that's only if it's done properly."  <br>
Banksy <br><br>

20.   Hi Nick, what is the biggest story of your time, how real is it?  <br>
a) Here's a story:  Some people say that if you are hyper organized you only have to work 4 hours a week!  <br>
Is it possible to outsource everything?  No, you must still spend many hours organising the direction of
that which you have out sourced; therefore the 14 hour work day is still necessary in order to have an advantage over your competition.  <br>
If all your competitors are working just 8 hours a day then just think of how far ahead of them you will be.  <br>
Now some days you will want to work less, that's ok, you don't have to become a workaholic but since what we do is what defines us...  <br>
You are what you do!  If you do nothing then you are nothing, <br>
if you help others, then you are a good Samaritan and you will be fulfilled. <br>
You can't outsource everything anyway, you have an unique talent that only you can bring to the table; and you must "bring it"!  <br>
b) We are the most fulfilled when we are helping others.  <br>
Take a few minutes to contemplate that last sentence and you will feel its truth.  <br>
c) You must love the daily flow of your endeavours.  If you don't, then you are doing something wrong and maybe it's time for a change.  <br>
You're not going to tap dance to work every day, some moments of your life will definitely challenge your happiness, those are
the days when you will have to "tough it out".  <br>
d) Put forth your best efforts and you will reap the rewards; and in the process bring "great benefit" to others.  <br>
e) If you only worked 4 hours a week you would eventually become bored and you would find yourself in a bad state.  <br>
Even if you just do art 8 hours a day, you are helping others and that could be your work.  <br>
You must train yourself to love your work.  <br>
It's as simple as just having your first thought when you wake up be "YES, I get to do _____ and _____ and _____all day, COOL!"  Fill in
those blanks!  Get excited about that which you will accomplish TODAY!!!  <br>
f) When you are 80 years old you will wish you were young again so that you could have the energy to work 8 hours or more a day.  YOU
need to do what you can today, you to need to focus, you need to help others, you need to 'accomplish' to acquire fulfilment.  <br>
g) Do you know anyone who has had any impact on the world, who only worked 4 hours a week?  <br>
h) There are two types of happiness:  Memory happens (things you accomplished in the past) and "in the moment" happiness.  You
must master both of those and bring them both together today!  <br>
You can even shrink the idea of "the past" to the last 14 hours you just experienced.  What did I accomplish today?  Think about what you
accomplished during the day as you fall asleep at night, it is a very rewarding feeling and will influence your dreams.  <br>
You will start to solve complex problems that you had during the day while you sleep.  That is a definite advantage.  <br>
'In the moment happiness' is acquired by liking the work that you are currently doing.  Learn to love the grind, focus in a relaxed way as you
go through your day.  Earn the respect of your peers!  <br>
i) Some contrast is ok, once a week do something completely different from your daily grind.  <br>
j) Are you on the right track?  If so, then tell me how you can spend even more than 40 hours a week on that track!
And if you can find a way to do that then your "in the moment happiness" will be even greater!  <br>
k) Don't forget to keep everything in balance.  <br><br>

In which of the four areas of your life (health, wealth, love, happiness) have you been looking for the short cut.
What is the simple solution to fix that behaviour?  <br><br><br>


The price of success is hard work, dedication to the job at hand, <br>
and the determination that whether we win or lose, <br>
we have applied the best of ourselves to the task at hand.  <br>
Vince Lombardi <br><br>

21.  Hi Nick, did you know that it is "genius" to simplify anything?  <br>
a) Try to make something that is really difficult, easy.  <br>
Make your problem your strength.  <br>
b) Contrast - compared to putting a man on the moon, everything is easy.  You must innovate your way out of
your problem.  <br>
c)  Break your problem down into ever smaller chunks and then work on the smallest chunk you end up with.  <br>
To make it even easier, contrast that small chunk with something that is super difficult (putting a man on the moon).  <br>
There are two types of people in the world, those who conquer fear and those who suffer and die from it.
Don't let your fear stop you from solving that super small chunk (problem).  <br>
d) Look for other people who have solved the problem you are trying to solve and follow them.  <br>
If they can do it, you can do it!  <br>
Look for the biggest people you can find, go to the top, read their books, watch their videos etc.  <br>
e) Find the largest contrast related to your problem and use it to condition your mind into the positive state,
"You know what, I can do this!", and do not follow people who are weak.  <br>
Keep in mind that a weak person has the ability to become a strong person and it can happen in an instance;
but look for consistency after they make the jump.  <br>
Remain observant of all the people in your circle and look for those who are on their way up.  <br>
Expand your circle quickly, go to the top!  <br>
f)  Don't let your contrast work against you.  Let's say you solve your money problem, "I want a million dollars";
then the next thing you know you are looking at someone who has $10 million and now you say to yourself
"I wish I had $10 million, owe, I'm sad again..."  Once you solve your problem, enjoy the accomplishment for a while.
Don't let your natural survival greed cause you to contrast your way into creating problems automatically.  Sure your
next goal is just around the corner but now is the time to stop and smell the roses for a bit.  Don't smell the roses for
to long though, you might get stung by a bee!  <br>
g) Use this idea of contrast bias to manipulate your mind and keep the simple things simple.  Forget to worry if you are stressed out.  <br>
"I am forgetting to worry, I am forgetting to worry.  Love, love, love love...repeat slowly, then slower and slower repeat, until
you are saying it so slowly you are falling asleep."  <br>
Say to yourself "how will I think about this stress situation 10 years from now?  Will I laugh at myself for being so worried about it...
Will the worrying help me solve the problem?"  <br>
No, of course not.  <br>
Don't avoid the problem but laugh at yourself now, "I'm worrying about something small again.  <br>
If you are so stressed out that you can't sleep then you better get professional help immediately.  <br>
h)  Now, just because you have broken your problem down into small chunks doesn't mean those small chunks will automatically
be easy to solve.  It can still be hard to solve them but a least you can focus all your powers like a laser beam
and cut that huge problem down to size.  Then focus your laser beam on one sub problem.  <br>
That is how you advance quickly.  Find the sub problems, and then work on the one
that needs to be solved first.  Find the order of the sub problems.  If I solve sub problem A first then sub problem B will be easier to solve.  <br>
Continue that logic until all the sub problems are solved; and low and behold, your goal has been accomplished.  <br>
Time to smell the roses, YEA!  And I like my work!  I am tap dancing!  <br>
Google - Singing In The Rain.  <br>
i)  Think of many contrasts that can help you.  Example:  If you are on welfare and live in the first world, then think about the
people who live in the third world and imagine their daily grind compared to yours.  How does that make you feel?  <br>
Write down 11 contrasts related to the other situations of YOUR current life!  <br><br>

What creates fear in you, pick something specific?  Now, who is the top person that you can think of (it can be anyone on the planet)
that has conquered that fear and contrast "yourself" with that person.  <br>
What specifically in your life is super simple that you are spending way too much time on (picking out your clothes for the day etc)?
Write down specifically what you will do so you are not wasting time on that.  <br>
What is the one thing in your life that you have over simplified and explain what additional work (sub problems) you will need to do in order to
acquire that goal!  <br><br><br>


Talent hits a target no one else can hit;  <br>
Genius hits a target no one else can see.  <br>
Arthur Schopenhauer <br><br>

22.  Hi Nick, are you investing in your mind?  <br>
a) Every day/week/month you should take some time keeping track of "your time" and any other books/accounts/expenses
and "To Do Lists" that you have created to maximize your organization.  <br>
b) You must keep an account of your emotional/financial etc life as well as the information you are putting in your brain every day.  <br>
c) Your Mind - Garbage in, garbage out.  Beneficial information in, positive actions out!  <br>
Sounds simple and it is, if you do it and track it.  Make a conscious effort to succeed starting with your own thoughts.  <br>
Your moment by moment thought must be about what you are putting into your mind and what, "what am I thinking about?"  <br>
Control that and you will be winning the "War Of Life"!  And it is a war.  There are 7 billion people on the planet and
we are all competing for what we want, make no mistake about it.  Even the Buddhist monks have desires.  If a monk desires
to have no desires, then a monk desires, to have no desires...  <br>
So desires are ok but you must have good desires which help you help others and you must control the way you feel about your desires.  <br>
Don't get all bent out of shape (angry/frustrated) because your goals aren't happening as quickly as you thought they would.  <br>
d) Every time you start to feel frustrated use that feeling to trigger a physical response in yourself automatically.
Here is what you do to learn this type of control:  <br>
The moment you start to feel frustrated you start a slow 10 deep breath breathing cycle.  Breath slowly so you don't get light headed.  <br>
After you finish the 10 deep breaths close your eyes for 30 seconds and empty your mind of all thoughts (think about nothing).
Then re-engage your focus back on the task at hand, with this relaxed feeling, or take a break.  You may be hungry or a bit
tired or in need of asking a significant other a question; take appropriate action.  <br>
You can think of variations or improvements of the above pattern to maximize its potential for you.  <br>
e) Do not major in minor issues and do not minor in major issues.  Keep track of the big picture and the longest term goal.  What are
the sub goals to accomplish long term happiness?  <br>
Keeping track of what your investment in your mind is, is the smallest sub goal of all, track it like an eagle and invest in it
like the billionaire Warren Buffet!  <br>
f) Take 30% of your discretionary income and invest it in your brain!  <br>
If you are completely broke, get a library card.  <br>
By those books, take those courses, plan a trip to visit your mentor.  Double down on your skills, whatever it takes, do it!  <br>
g) Your brain is a kitchen, the kitchen of life, fill your kitchen with many raw ingredients so you can create the best for you.  <br>
To cook up an amazing life for yourself you will need tons of ingredients.  <br>
Once you have many ingredients sit in a dark room, close your eyes, and you will come up with great ideas.  And if you don't
have any great ideas at that time then think of the great ideas of others and improve upon them.  Build a better mouse trap as they
say.  <br>
h) Blend the ingredients of different art forms.  Example:  <br>
blend painting and finance with music...  <br>
The possibilities are endless!  Create your own unique soup.  <br>
i) The truth/happiness is in the middle.  Money can bring you happiness or it can bring you sadness.  As you invest in your mind
you will eventually become richer both spiritually and monetarily.  You must use your new powers for good otherwise you will
self-destruct.  If you get to the top of success mountain by yourself there is a good chance you will jump off the cliff.  <br>
Now if you have friends who are into cliff jumping then this is ok, but if you do not then you probably won't have a
parachute on.  Prepare, prepare, prepare, invest in your mind first, all actions start with thoughts.  <br>
j) Here is the order of reality:
Thoughts, Feelings, Actions...  in that order!  That is the physics of nature applied to human consciousness.  That is how it is!  <br>
Make no mistake about it, if you are in control of your thoughts you are in control of your feelings, if you are in
control of your feelings, YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF YOUR ACTIONS!!!  This is a law of nature.  <br>
Have you ever done some stupid action and then asked yourself, "I don't know why I did that?"  Many actions are done at the
unconscious level if we are not monitoring our thoughts at that time.  <br>
t h o u g h t s<span style="word-spacing:0.60em"> </span>   f e e l i n g s<span style="word-spacing:0.60em"> </span>   a c t i o n s  <br>
k)  Do not invest in things that rust, rot or depreciate; invest in your mind first and foremost!  <br>
You need to be worth more later so invest in yourself first.  <br>
L) If you have a little bit of money send your mentor a gift, what you give will come back to you and may come back
as very important information for your brain, invest in your mind!  <br><br>

How are you going to invest in your mind?  Double down!  Write down the plan (library, courses, books, seminars etc).  <br><br><br>


"Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants."
Epictetus <br><br>

23.  Hi Nick, is everything going good these days?  Are you re-making the world in your own image?  <br>
a) Take your world and re-imagine it, re-invent it,  take it apart and put it back together again in different orders,
and perhaps do it in ways that it has never been done by anybody ever before.  <br>
b) What are the most bizarre comparisons you can make with yourself?  Can you imagine yourself being, Bill Gates,
Mother Theresa, Walt Disney, Bill Clinton, Snoop Dogg.  <br>
c) What is the picture in your mind that your life is going to look like?  <br>
What is your outlook on life?  Are you innovating your way out of your problems and into the ultimate vision,
that you have, of your future?   <br>
Don't be a victim, remember there are 3 types of people:  <br>
Those who watch things happen.  <br>
Those who wonder what happened.  <br>
And those who make things happen.  <br>
Engage your optimism to the maximum if you are feeling like, "But what if nothing comes of my efforts?"  <br>
Then do some physical exercise to wake/relax your brain up and re-energize your motivation.  <br>
d) Take what you really like doing (healthy choices only that are good for you and others) and think of a way to make money at it.  <br>
No matter what it is, there is a way, innovate.  <br>
e) Experiment, every failure is a learning experience that gets you closer to your goal.  <br>
f) Start by watching things happen and then learn how to make things happen.  Don't be in that category of wondering what happened.  <br>
g) Try this mental exercise:  <br>
If you were independently wealthy and you had finished doing all the normal things like travelling and buying all those material
items that you want, THEN WHAT would you do?  <br>
You would probably do the things that you are doing in your spare time right now.  Now I am not talking about you being a trillionaire
and having all the money in the world.  "Owe, I'm going to solve the world hunger problem overnight".  No, I mean if you had like say
$50 million.  What are the things that you are doing in your spare time right now.  How can you use those things you like doing to innovate
your way into your ultimate, happy imagined life?  <br>
What would you change in your day?  <br>
What is it in terms of your goal that moves you forward in terms of motivation?  <br>
Who is around you, are you surrounded by family, are you surrounded by professional people?  <br>
Do you see yourself in a corporate environment, home office or at the beach etc, what is it that moves you towards your goal?  <br>
That is the world that you need to define very specifically, today!  <br>
Do small dreams motivate you?  <br>
Imagine yourself being able to do whatever you want to do, dream big!  <br>
Then balance your large dream with what you observe in reality.  Search for the path and when you see it, go for it!  <br>
There will be failures (learning experiences) along the way but that is part of the adventure/fun!  <br>
h)  When you look at your life, who would you most want to be around (anyone you want)?  Think big.
What tools would you like to have?  What art forms would you like to master? etc.  Define your dream then reverse engineer
the path that will get you there.  What are the sub steps?  Start from the dream and work backwards.  <br>
j)  Don't chase a dream that doesn't match up with your natural skill set.  If you don't know what your natural skill set is
then take some of those tests online that will point you in the right direction.  Google - "my natural skill set".  And see
number 12 above.  <br>
k)  The people who start the businesses and run the world all have an entrepreneurial spirit, develop this spirit and those
people will be attracted to you and then they will like you, and then they will hire you (if you need a job)
or loan you money.  <br>
L) You are allowed two big picture goals:  <br>
One is the humanitarian goal and the other is the selfish goal.  So help people first and then buy your paradise island second.  <br>
You actually need to do those goals in that order.  Obviously!  <br>
m) Never mind money for a bit.  What would your best world look like health (food exercise) wise?  <br>
What would your best world look like love (friends family romance) wise?  Are you an extrovert or an introvert (somewhere in the middle),
build your social life around
the type of person you are.  <br>
What would your best world look like happiness (things you like to do balanced out correctly) wise.  <br>
How would you balance everything for complete self fulfilment?  <br>
What would you do in the morning, afternoon, evening?  <br>
n) Now think of the inverse.  What are all the things that you want to remove from your life?  How will you do that, when will you start?  <br>
o) Now wealth, what does your world look like imagination wise on a day to day basis?  How will you generate wealth?  How rich
do you have to be to be happy.  Is a small apartment great enough or do you want more?  Be specific with what you want, keep
it in your mind's eye at all times!  Be realistic with regards to your current/potential skill set, and match your skills
with what you like to do in your spare time (that is where you will make your money).  <br>
Remember - Your thoughts create your feelings and your feelings create your actions.  What you concentrate on during the day
you will dream about at night.  Have great dreams, learn to fly in your dreams it ROCKS!  <br>
p)  At least live your life with intention.  If you want to be an entrepreneur but your current circumstances dictate that you need more money
then continue working hard at your job for a year and save up that money!  <br>
q)  Concentrate the most on your social life (personality) first, everything else will hinge off of that.  The people you hang out
with are "the people" you will "become"!  <br><br>

Use your imagination:  <br>
What will your future world look like health wise?  <br>
Where is your income going to come from in your ideal world?  Reverse engineer that!  <br>
Socially what is your ideal situation/s?  <br>
How are you going to get happy, you will need charity, culture, art, music
spirituality, and even a little bit of greed etc, balance everything out.  <br>
Define all of the above, be specific, write the answers down, cut some things out, add some new things in,
you can have anything you want but not everything.  <br>
Life is like a parachute jump, you only get one chance, and will you fall to your death quickly because you didn't pack your parachute
or will you feel the gentle warm breeze brush gently across your face as you glide through your ideal life of joy.  <br>
The most powerful word in the world is "IMAGINE"!  <br>
Make it happen now!  <br><br><br>


"In a time of destruction, create something."  <br>
Maxine Hong Kingston <br><br>

awareness, <br>
feel the fear and do it anyway!  <br><br>

BALANCE ALL!!! <br><br><br><br><br><br>

Thesis, antitheses and the synthesis of those produces balance and success.  <br>
David H Potschka  <br><br>

Forgiveness is easier, safer, enlightening and more profitable than revenge.  <br>
David H Potschka <br><br>

"They are angry with me, because I know what I am."  Said the little eagle.  <br>
"How do you know that they are angry with you?"  <br>
"Because, they despise me for wanting to soar, <br>
they only want me to peck at the dirt, <br>
looking for ants, with them. But I can't do that.  <br>
I don't have chicken feet, I have eagle wings."  <br>
"And what is so wrong with having eagle wings and no chicken feet?"  <br>
Asked the old owl. "I'm not sure, that's what I'm trying to find out."  <br>
"They hate you because you know that you are an eagle <br>
and they want you to think you are a chicken <br>
so that you will peck at the ground looking for ants and worms, <br>
so that you will never know that you are an eagle <br>
and always think yourself a chicken. Let them hate you, <br>
they will always be chickens, and you will always be an eagle.  <br>
You must fly. You must soar." Said the old owl.  <br>
